# Exploring the Emergent Abilities of SwinIA for Object Segmentation

This branch contains the supporting code for our work, where we explore the emergent abilities of the transformer-based model
SwinIA. We focus on the semantic segmentation task. We show that the
model primarily developed for the denoising task exhibits a promising
performance on the image segmentation use case on several cell datasets.
We compare the original model with other models, such as
Noise2Same on 3 popular cell microscopy datasets.
